I want to ask applicants on my website to submit their names and emails, this is a simple HTML and PHP code that designs a website.
The info that they submit, I will save them in excel format.

To accomplish this, we need a simple HTML form for users to submit their names and emails and a PHP script to handle the submission. The submitted data will be saved to a CSV file, which can be opened as an Excel file.

Ubuntu:
I used XAMPP as a localhost. it is located in /opt/lampp/students file (XAMPP is /opt/lampp).
To run: place the codes in /var/www/html 
then copy and paste "http://localhost/" in browser.
